## My process
- First of all, I created the container in html archive. I was playing with the colors, width and heights.
- Added the CSS to the container and all the elements (such as h1, p)
- At the end I had to research on google on how to integrate the API using Js.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I know this is a beginner project but I learn alot since I never had the opportunity to integrate an API.
I also learn on how to add this HTML to my webpage

Proud of this js code:

```js
const fetchAdvice = async () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
